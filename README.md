### Hello, I'm Shreya Hiremath 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠️ Projects

### *Pollution-Free City*  

*OVERVIEW:*  

- Flood prediction and early warning systems: Helps minimize flood impacts by forecasting events and providing timely alerts. They use data from weather models, river monitoring, and satellite imagery to predict floods accurately. Early warnings enable communities to prepare through evacuations and protective measures. These systems are vital for reducing loss of life, property, and environmental damage.
- Flood evacuation planning: Ensures the safe and efficient movement of people from flood-prone areas to safer locations. It involves risk assessments, route mapping, resource allocation, and clear communication strategies. Effective planning minimizes casualties and disruption during flood emergencies.
- Flood risk mapping: Identifies areas vulnerable to flooding by analyzing factors like topography, rainfall, river flow, and land use. It visually represents flood-prone zones, helping planners prioritize mitigation efforts and allocate resources. These maps are crucial for informed decision-making in urban planning, disaster management, and community preparedness.
-Drainage network optimization: Enhances the efficiency of water flow in urban and rural areas to prevent flooding. It involves designing, analyzing, and upgrading drainage systems using hydrological models and advanced tools. Optimized networks reduce waterlogging, protect infrastructure, and improve resilience against heavy rainfall events.
